# Queen Bee - II

In this project I have written a second option to my Queen Bee memory card game.

In order to add flip card animation, I made changes to my JS and Css files.

In my new code I am using the .toggle method to add and remove a class name from the card element, you can see other different methods 

I used in the attached JS file.
